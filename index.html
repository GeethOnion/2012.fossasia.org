                <p>OpenDesign.Asia is dedicated at promoting sharing among designers and cooperation across the continent and around the world. The initiative was started by a group of international contributors during <a href="http://fossasia.org">FOSSASIA</a> 2010 in Ho Chi Minh City by <a href="https://twitter.com/hpdang">Hong Phuc Dang</a> and <a href="http://mariobehling.de)">Mario Behling</a>. </p><br>
                <p>Open Design is the development of graphical interfaces, physical products, machines and systems through use of publicly shared design information and Open Source applications. The goals and philosophy are identical to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">Open Source Software</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_hardware">Open Source Hardware</a> design, but reside in a different paradigm.</p><br>
                <p>The "open design" movement as of 2011 is fairly nascent and holds great potential for the future. In some respects design and engineering are even more suited to open collaborative development than the increasingly common open-source software projects, because with 3D models and photographs the concept can often be understood visually. It is not even necessary that the project members speak the same languages to usefully collaborate. </p><br>
                <p>Compared to software development where there are mature and widely used tools available and the duplication and distribution of code cost next to nothing there are barries to overcome in Open Design project, especially when it involves the production of physical objects. Creating, testing and modifying physical designs is not quite so straightforward because of the effort, time and cost required to create the physical artefact; although with access to emerging flexible computer-controlled manufacturing techniques the complexity and effort of construction become easier.</p><br>
